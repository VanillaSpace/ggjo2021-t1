What is that thing? OH wait! I think it's that Boom doll! I have faced him before. It jumps pretty high before attacking.

First Frag:

If you want your tiny friend, you have to come and get him!!!!
I can't wait to Smash you!!!!

Second Frag:
Why can't I recall anything? Why is this place so familiar? Have I been here before? 
Unknown voice: Oh well done! So you passed my boom dolls!!!

Third Frag:
